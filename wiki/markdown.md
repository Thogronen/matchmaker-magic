# Markdown Guide

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format plain text documents using simple syntax. It's widely used for writing documentation, README files, forum posts, and more. This guide is to reference the Markdown syntax and how to use it.

## Syntax Overview

### Headings

Headings in Markdown are created using hash (`#`) symbols. The number of hash symbols indicates the level of the heading, with one hash symbol representing Heading 1, two for Heading 2, and so on.

```markdown
# Main Header
## Sub-Header 1
### Sub-Header 1.1
## Sub-Header 2
